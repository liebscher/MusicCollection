# Music Collection

A locally stored and run browser application for recording, logging, and rating your music collection.

Integrates with Spotify API to access a vast database of album, artist, and track information to fill out the details of your personal music collection.

Features the ability for the user to compare two albums under a dozen different categories which ideally define the best albums. Through these pairwise comparisons, scores are assigned to each album and a ranking is computed.
