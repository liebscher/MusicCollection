# `src/actions/`

Much of applications algorithmic code can be found in these directories. API calls are also made here.

The `collection/` directory handles actions made upon the collection, including filtering, sorting, adding, deleting, editing, and making comparisons.

The `search/` directory handles actions made in the search component.
